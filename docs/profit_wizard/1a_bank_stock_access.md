## Have you unlocked both the Bank and the Stock Market?

- [✅ Yes, both unlocked](1b_bank_stock_understanding.md?bank=yes&stock=yes)
- [❌ Not yet or only one](1b_bank_stock_understanding.md?bank=no&stock=no)

### 🧠 Why this matters:

The **Bank** (unlocked by default) offers reliable, compounding interest — crucial for idle income.
The **Stock Market** unlocks passive perks like FHC refill chains and YAB rental income.
These systems form the backbone of long-term profits.
