## 💸 Step 7

🧠 **Your Answers So Far:**
- Faction: ✅
- Travel Tools: ✅
## Are you part of (or able to join) a 5★ company?
- [🍔 Yes — Grocery, Sweet Shop, etc.](8_market_access.md?company=yes)
- [🚫 Not yet / Don't know](8_market_access.md?company=no)
### 🧠 Why this matters:
5★ companies provide some of the **most reliable and sustainable income streams** in Torn — especially when paired with other passive tools like banking, travel, and faction perks.

Some give **sellable items** every few days.

Others offer **stat or XP boosts**, **cash bonuses**, or **travel advantages** that compound earnings dramatically.
