## 💸 Step 4

🧠 **Your Answers So Far:**
- Suitcase: ✅
- Travel: ✅
- Bank Access: ✅
## Do you regularly deposit in the Bank for passive interest?
- [🏦 Yes, habitually](5_merits.md?bank_use=yes)
- [💸 No, I don't use it much](5_merits.md?bank_use=no)
### 🧠 Why this matters:
The Bank is **your interest engine** — set-it-and-forget-it.

- Deposit Torn cash while training or traveling
- Use **Banking merits** to unlock longer terms and boost interest
- Compound idle gains into mid-game investment capital

💡 Example:
A $10 million deposit over 7 days at base 0.3% returns ~$210,000.
With interest merits, that could rise to $300,000+ — **just for logging in less**.

> The more Bank merits you invest, the higher your interest caps and term options. It's free money for strategic patience.
