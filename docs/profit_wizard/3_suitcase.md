## 💸 Step 3

🧠 **Your Answers So Far:**
- Level: ✅
- Travel: ✅
## Do you currently own or borrow a Suitcase?
- [🎒 Yes](4_bank_usage.md?suitcase=yes)
- [🚫 No](4_bank_usage.md?suitcase=no)
### 🧠 Why this matters:
A **suitcase multiplies your travel profit** by increasing the number of items you can bring back per trip — plushies, drugs, books, or high-margin items.

Pair it with Private Island bonuses, job perks, or faction perks to become a mobile money-making machine.
