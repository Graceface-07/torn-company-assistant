To gain access, you need one of the following:
- Reach **Level 15**
- Spend **50 points** at the Points Market under "Stock Ticker Access"

Once unlocked, you can buy shares from the stock ticker in the City — some stocks offer powerful perks like refill items (FHC, Xanax) or passive boosts (YAB, DNB, IBB).

💡 Not sure whether to spend points or wait?
If you're close to Level 15, it may be smarter to wait and save your points for perks or energy. Otherwise, 50 points can fast-track you into early investing.
