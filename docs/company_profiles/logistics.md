Logistics is built for players who travel frequently — whether trading, collecting plushies, or farming items. The perks make those loops faster and more profitable.

✅ **Faction Utility**  
Item return bonuses from high-ranking staff can feed into **faction armories** or **smuggling systems**, especially if multiple members work here in tandem.

✅ **Stackable with Travel Perks**  
Effects stack well with:  
• **Private Island airport upgrade**  
• **Merits and education** reducing cooldown  
• Smuggling gear or job/faction synergies  
Great for players building Torn’s cross-border empires.
