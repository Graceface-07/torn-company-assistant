## 🎯 Weapon & Armour Stat Glossary

Master these stats to build smarter, hit harder, and survive longer.

---

**💥 Damage**
How much health your attack removes per hit.

- Higher damage = better for tanks and burst damage builds
- Not all hits deal the same amount — criticals and quality play a role
- *Example:* A Desert Eagle may two-shot a glass cannon; a Glock probably won't

---

**🎯 Accuracy**
The chance your attack actually lands — especially against dodgy opponents.

- Higher accuracy helps counter Speed/Dex builds
- Ranged weapons tend to have better base accuracy than melee
- *Example:* Rifles and sniper-class weapons thrive on high accuracy

---

**⚡ Speed**
How quickly and how often your weapon strikes.

- Influences attack frequency and who acts first in combat
- Fast weapons = more chances to break through defenses
- *Example:* A knife can strike multiple times while a shotgun reloads

---

**🏷️ Quality**
Hidden modifier from *Poor* to *Excellent* that boosts weapon effectiveness.

- Impacts everything: damage, accuracy, critical chance, and even reload speed
- Two "identical" weapons can perform very differently based on quality
- *Tip:* Always compare quality before selling or upgrading gear

---

**🔄 Ammo**
Total rounds before needing to reload (firearms only).

- More ammo = longer uptime, less vulnerability
- Weapons with burst fire tend to burn through ammo fast
- *Example:* SMGs often have high ammo counts but low damage-per-shot

---

**⚖️ Weight**
How heavy your gear is — affects dodge and initiative.

- Heavy weapons slow attacks; heavy armour crushes evasion
- Light gear keeps builds agile and unpredictable
- *Example:* Riot armour tanks damage but destroys dodge-based builds
