# 🔍 Working Stats

> *Your hidden résumé in Torn — these three stats define how well you perform and earn across all careers.*

## 🧠 What Are Working Stats?

Torn tracks three hidden attributes:

- **Manual Labor (MAN)** – physical effort  
- **Intelligence (INT)** – logic, analysis, creativity  
- **Endurance (END)** – stamina, focus, time-on-task

These stats aren’t visible in your profile but directly affect hiring, promotion, income, and special perks in all company types and some city jobs.
