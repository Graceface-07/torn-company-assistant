## ⚠️ Risks & Limitations

- Time-gated: you can't rush the cooldown
- Limited market demand — often sold to factionmates
- Consumes Hospital actions (can't stack other healing duties)
- Not beginner-friendly unless faction-supported

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Use downtime (e.g. after attacks) to trigger the cooldown
- Coordinate faction buying: guaranteed buyers, low tax, no hassle
- Save bags for chains or ranking pushes where demand spikes
- Pair with morphine sales if already operating in the Hospital
