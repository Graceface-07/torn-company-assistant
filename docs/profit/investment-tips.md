## 💰 Investment Strategies

### 📊 Stock Rotation

- Buy utility stocks for long-term perks (DNB, LTB, NNB, YAB)
- Trade volatility stocks for short-term flips
- Use TornStats or scripts to monitor trends
- Typical return: **10%–60% per quarter**

### 🏦 Interest Looping

- Rotate between 7–60 day deposits
- Compound returns into stocks or trading fund
- Stack Donator and YAB perks for max %
- Est. ROI: **4%–11%/cycle**

### 🛠️ Item Holding

- Stockpile event items (Plushies, Morphine, Candies)
- Resell during peak demand (Valentine's, Chains, Halloween)
- Predict seasonal cycles for arbitrage

### 🪙 Currency Holding / Crypto

- (Future-proof) Some Torn updates hint at digital assets
- Keep small reserve in rare currencies or collectibles

## ⚠️ Risks & Limitations

- Stock market slumps: don't over-leverage perks
- Market shifts — event rebalances can tank item values
- Bank interest ties up cash (can't emergency spend)
- Overexposure to collectibles = liquidity problems

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Run a sheet tracking total net worth, monthly growth, passive ROI
- Set thresholds: e.g. reinvest interest over $5M into YAB/DNB perks
- Spread risk: 40% stocks, 40% bank, 20% trading stockpile
- Watch update changelogs — system revamps = investment ripple effects
