### 🏦 Bank Interest

- Deposit cash for fixed terms (7–120 days)
- Returns scale with amount and time
- Bonus: Donator Status adds +0.5% to all deposits
- ROI: **4–11%**, depending on deposit tier

---

### 🏘️ Housing Passives

- Rental income from multi-occupancy housing (e.g. Apartments)
- Rare/long term — not ideal for most users
- Better used for stat bonuses than rent farming

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Limitations

- Stock perk values fluctuate with player demand
- Bank interest locks cash — illiquid
- Some perks require millions or billions to unlock
- Passive ≠ instant — best for long-term planners

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Use a stock script or dashboard (e.g. TornStats) to track perk costs
- Set alerts for dip-buying perks (get in before others)
- Compound interest: bank, then reinvest into more perks
- Stack stock perks with company bonuses or mission usage
