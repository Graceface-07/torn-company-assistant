# 📈 Trading & Arbitrage

> *Buy low, sell high — Torn's oldest hustle still pays, if you know your markets.*

---

## 🔧 Setup Requirements

- Starting capital (recommended: $5M+)
- Access to a Bazaar, Trade system, or Auction House
- Basic understanding of price trends and event cycles
- Optional: Spreadsheet, price bot, or market tracker

---

## 💰 Profit Strategies

### 🪙 Point Flipping

- Buy points at low (weekly refill) ~45–55K
- Sell high during wars/missions at 65–75K+
- Profit: **20%–40% per cycle**

### 🧪 Refill Trading (Energy/Nerve)

- Resell cans, Xanax, and FHCs during high demand
- Pair with job cans or stock benefits (DNB)
- Use Bazaar for passive sales; undercut top listings

### 💼 Barter Trades

- Trade surplus items for underpriced goods
- Example: Book ➝ Rare Plushie ➝ Trade ➝ Refill ➝ Cash
- Higher margin, but time-intensive

### ⏰ Snipe Arbitrage

- Watch AH or Trade Chat for mispriced items
- Grab and relist or flip via bulk orders

---

## ⚠️ Risks & Limitations

- Tax on Bazaar sales reduces margin
- High competition from bots and experienced flippers
- Scams in barters or trades if not cautious
- Liquidity risk — avoid tying up too much in slow-selling items

---

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

- Use bulk pricing: 10x Candy @ discount to offload faster
- Run a clean Bazaar banner: emojis + keywords = mobile visibility
- Track price trends during events (e.g. plushie drops pre-V-Day)
- Pair with a spreadsheet: track flips, margin %, ROI
